**Technologies Used:**

* CSS
* Javascript
* JQuery Library plugins
* Flickity plugin for product showcase
* Flexbox 

**Personal Learnings:**
This project involved a lot of skills pertaining to the use of flexbox, on top of building up on our original layout for Aloha 1. I learned that it is much more efficient to plan my code ahead of time so it can be more modular and also much cleaner for myself and others to look at. The use of JQuery was fascinating because of the many different types of code that people have already built and is an open source for everyone. This project has strengthened my concept of box models and especially the use of flexbox to organize content. The use of Javascript also is quite interesting because it allows you to interact with the webpage much more than what CSS and HTML can offer. 

**Improvements**
* Added a hover on the product categories so that when you hover, it removes the linear gradient
* Added a hover on the product categories text, I used media queries so the text increases in size depending on the screens pixel width
